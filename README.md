AsusTec is a point of sale model composed of two main services, namely the sales service and the stock service.
I created this small project when I was in the second semester of my master, the aim of this website is to manage the online shopping, everyone can buy a lot of products after registering on this website, and obtaining a ticket containing the names and prices of the products purchased. He can also see charts that show the percentage of available products.
